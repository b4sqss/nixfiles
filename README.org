#+TITLE: My nixos configuration
This is a simple nixos configuration I use as my daily driver. It also has a flake and a home-manager configuration.

* Nixos configuration
This can be found on system/configuration.nix and it has a few packages and services.

* Home-manager
On the home manager configuration there is my shell, vim, xmonad, tmux...
Nothing to fancy either, but usefull

* flake
The flake.nix is usefull foreasily building both configs(using the scripts) and also for updating both of them in a easier way.

It looks like this when it's built: [[./user/configs/screenshot.png]]
