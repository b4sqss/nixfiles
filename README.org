#+TITLE: NIXFILES
My desktop configuration using nixos + home-manager

It's still pretty simple but I like it and it has everything I need, which is:
- my configuration.nix
- my home-manager configuration
  - ncmpcpp
  - emacs
  - nvim
  - dunst
  - zathura
  - zsh
  - tmux
    And a couple other stuff
